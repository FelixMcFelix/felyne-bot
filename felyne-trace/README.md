# Felyne-trace

This module offers tools to read, write, and parse anonymised voice data traces from Felyne.

## Format
Trace files contain a single `FelyneTrace`, encoded with bincode and compressed using zlib.
Struct-level documentation should explain the inner format, structure, and purpose of fields.
